# 🧬 Ataeru – A Decentralized Healthcare System for Donors

Ataeru is a decentralized healthcare platform designed to revolutionize donation systems—including sperm donors, egg donors, and surrogates—through trust, transparency, and cutting-edge decentralized identity technology.

## 🚀 Overview

Ataeru solves core challenges in the donation process by enabling ethical, secure, and user-controlled participation. It empowers all parties—donors, users, and hospitals—through personalized AI agents, verifiable credentials, health NFTs, and decentralized workflows.

## ⚙️ Core Features & Workflow

### 🔐 Decentralized Participation & Verification
- **Hospitals Register** via **CHEQD** Zero-Knowledge (ZK) verification to ensure legitimacy.
- **Users & Donors Register** to participate in the ecosystem with privacy and autonomy.

### 🤖 Personalized AI Agents
- **Users**: AI recommends hospitals and donation opportunities based on health & preferences.
- **Donors**: AI matches donation history and health data with hospital needs.
- AIs can be **autonomous** or **partially delegated** — users choose the level of control.

### 🏥 Hospital Requests & Participation
- Hospitals publish donation requests with detailed criteria.
- Donors and users apply to fulfill them; approved participants begin medical processes.

### 📈 Process Tracking & Health NFTs
- Each donation is tracked and graded based on ethical and medical compliance.
- Completion earns a **Process NFT**: a tokenized, anonymized, verifiable health record.
- NFTs are **user-owned** and can be monetized (e.g., sold to healthcare research orgs).

### ⚖️ Reputation & Slashing Mechanism
- Violations of hospital rules/ethics lead to **reputation slashing**:
  - Affects reward levels
  - Limits eligibility for future applications
  - Reduces trust within the ecosystem

### 🛡 Privacy & Anonymity
- Verified, anonymous participation powered by **ZK tech** and decentralized identity.
- Full data ownership: users control their information and its distribution.

## 🧠 AI Scheduling & Verida Integration

### ✅ Current Implementation:
- **Verida Connect Button**: Persistent sessions using `iron-session`.
- **Smart Calendar Bookings**:
  - Donors: AI checks availability and books appointments.
  - Hospitals: Create invites and track appointment scheduling.

### 🔮 Future Vision:
- Move toward a **fully autonomous AI scheduler**:
  - One-click booking with minimal user interaction.
  - Smart invite generation for hospitals.
  - AI performs **sentiment analysis** & **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to craft compelling donor invitations.
